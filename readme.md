# Gap Year Stream (gapyearstream.com)

ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, I'm Leon! I graduated high school in May 2022, and I'm currently taking two gap years to focus on entrepreneurship.

As a software developer, entrepreneurship involves a lot of screen time, and it turns out that it's pretty easy to get distracted when you're sitting in front of a screen for that long.

Thus, I started this 24/7 Gap Year Stream as a precommitment to ensure I stay focused on growing my startup [Dialect](https://dialect.so) over the coming year, and I invite you to join me in chasing our ambitions together at [gapyearstream.com](https://gapyearstream.com)!
